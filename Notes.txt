Why not file system or why db?
1. Data inconsistency and Redundancy...
2. Concurrent data access problems...
3. Not possible to make data relationships b/w data...
4. Isolation problems(for example: file1.dat and file2.txt)...
5. Faster data access problems and manipulation problems with file system...

(Although all above can be done by writing programs for file system but instead of 
writing it for every file, we prefer centralized data management with the help of DBMS...)

DBMS basically provides abstracted view of the data to different users...
